# Engine

The Engine is the Marvin application, the result of user's implementation, including code, datasets(artifacts), models, etc. We have some [engine examples on github](https://github.com/marvin-ai/marvin-public-engines) and you could install them like described in [Running an example engine](ch3_get_started/engine_examples.md)
